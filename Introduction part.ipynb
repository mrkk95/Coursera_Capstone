This brings us to the question: Do people move until they find a place to settle down where they truly feel happy, or do our wants and needs change over time, prompting us to eventually leave a town we once called home for a new area that will bring us satisfaction? Or, do we too often move to a new area without knowing exactly what we\u2019re getting into, forcing us to turn tail and run at the first sign of discomfort? \n "
